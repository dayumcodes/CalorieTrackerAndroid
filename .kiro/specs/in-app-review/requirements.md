# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements Google Play Store in-app review functionality for the Calorie Tracker Android app. The system will intelligently prompt users to rate and review the app at optimal moments during their user journey, following Google Play's best practices and policies. The implementation will use React Native's in-app review capabilities to provide a seamless, non-intrusive review experience that helps improve app store ratings and user engagement.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who has been actively using the app, I want to be prompted to rate the app at appropriate moments, so that I can easily provide feedback without leaving the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has opened the app at least 5 times THEN the system SHALL be eligible to show a review prompt
2. WHEN a user successfully logs food entries multiple times THEN the system SHALL increase the likelihood of showing a review prompt
3. WHEN a user completes a positive action (like achieving a goal) THEN the system SHALL consider showing a review prompt
4. WHEN the review prompt is triggered THEN the system SHALL use Google Play's native in-app review API
5. WHEN a user dismisses or completes a review THEN the system SHALL not show another prompt for at least 30 days

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the review prompts to appear at natural, non-disruptive moments, so that my app experience remains smooth and enjoyable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is loading or during critical user actions THEN the system SHALL NOT show review prompts
2. WHEN a user has just completed a successful food logging session THEN the system SHALL consider it an optimal time for review prompts
3. WHEN a user reaches milestone achievements (like 7-day streak) THEN the system SHALL consider showing a review prompt
4. WHEN a user is in the middle of data entry or navigation THEN the system SHALL defer the review prompt
5. WHEN the app detects user frustration (errors, crashes) THEN the system SHALL NOT show review prompts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to track review prompt effectiveness and user engagement, so that I can optimize the review request strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a review prompt is shown THEN the system SHALL log the event with timestamp and user context
2. WHEN a user interacts with the review prompt THEN the system SHALL track the action (dismissed, completed, etc.)
3. WHEN review prompts are triggered THEN the system SHALL respect rate limiting to avoid spam
4. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL initialize review tracking with stored user preferences
5. WHEN review data needs to be persisted THEN the system SHALL use AsyncStorage for local storage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the review process to be quick and native to Android, so that I don't have to leave the app or deal with external browser redirects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a review prompt appears THEN it SHALL use Google Play's native in-app review dialog
2. WHEN the native review is not available THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to external Play Store link
3. WHEN a user submits a review THEN they SHALL remain within the app context
4. WHEN the review dialog is dismissed THEN the app SHALL continue normal operation without interruption
5. WHEN there are API errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to configure review prompt triggers and timing, so that I can optimize user engagement and app store ratings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring review triggers THEN the system SHALL support customizable thresholds for app opens
2. WHEN setting review timing THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of cooldown periods between prompts
3. WHEN defining trigger events THEN the system SHALL support multiple trigger conditions (app opens, successful actions, milestones)
4. WHEN review settings change THEN the system SHALL apply new configurations without requiring app restart
5. WHEN debugging review functionality THEN the system SHALL provide development mode overrides for testing
