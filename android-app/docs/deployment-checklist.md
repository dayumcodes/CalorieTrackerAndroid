### 2. Manual Testing Procedures

#### New User Testing
1. **Fresh Installation**
   - Install app on clean device
   - Complete onboarding process
   - Use app normally for several sessions
   - Verify review prompt appears after meeting criteria

2. **Trigger Testing**
   ```typescript
   // Test each trigger type
   const triggers = [
     'APP_OPEN',
     'SUCCESSFUL_FOOD_LOG',
     'MILESTONE_ACHIEVED',
     'STREAK_MILESTONE'
   ];
   
   // For each trigger, verify:
   // - Minimum count requirements
   // - Timing appropriateness
   // - User experience quality
   ```

#### Existing User Testing
1. **Migration Testing**
   - Update app on device with existing data
   - Verify data migration works correctly
   - Check that review system respects existing user state
   - Ensure no duplicate prompts

2. **Edge Case Testing**
   - Test with corrupted storage data
   - Test with network connectivity issues
   - Test with disabled Google Play Services
   - Test rapid app switching scenarios

### 3. Performance Testing

#### Performance Test Script
```typescript
const performanceTest = async () => {
  const metrics = {
    initTime: 0,
    memoryUsage: 0,
    storageTime: 0,
    triggerEvalTime: 0
  };
  
  // Test initialization time
  const initStart = Date.now();
  await ReviewManager.getInstance().initialize();
  metrics.initTime = Date.now() - initStart;
  
  // Test memory usage
  const memoryBefore = performance.memory?.usedJSHeapSize || 0;
  // Perform review operations
  const memoryAfter = performance.memory?.usedJSHeapSize || 0;
  metrics.memoryUsage = memoryAfter - memoryBefore;
  
  // Test storage performance
  const storageStart = Date.now();
  await storageService.getUserMetrics();
  metrics.storageTime = Date.now() - storageStart;
  
  // Test trigger evaluation time
  const triggerStart = Date.now();
  await triggerEngine.evaluateTrigger({
    trigger: 'APP_OPEN',
    userState: {},
    appState: {}
  });
  metrics.triggerEvalTime = Date.now() - triggerStart;
  
  return metrics;
};
```

#### Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] Initialization time < 100ms
- [ ] Memory usage < 1MB
- [ ] Storage operations < 50ms
- [ ] Trigger evaluation < 20ms
- [ ] Review prompt display < 200ms

### 4. User Acceptance Testing

#### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path Testing**
   - User completes positive actions
   - Review prompt appears at appropriate time
   - User completes review successfully
   - System respects cooldown period

2. **Negative Path Testing**
   - User dismisses review prompt
   - User encounters errors during review
   - System handles failures gracefully
   - Fallback mechanisms work correctly

3. **Boundary Testing**
   - Test minimum trigger thresholds
   - Test maximum prompts per user
   - Test cooldown period boundaries
   - Test configuration edge cases

## Rollback Procedures

### 1. Emergency Rollback

If critical issues are discovered:

#### Immediate Actions
```typescript
// Emergency disable via remote config (if available)
const emergencyDisable = {
  triggers: {
    APP_OPEN: { enabled: false },
    SUCCESSFUL_FOOD_LOG: { enabled: false },
    MILESTONE_ACHIEVED: { enabled: false },
    STREAK_MILESTONE: { enabled: false }
  }
};

// Or disable via feature flag
setFeatureFlag('in_app_review_enabled', false);
```

#### Rollback Steps
1. [ ] Disable review system via remote configuration
2. [ ] Monitor error rates and user feedback
3. [ ] Prepare hotfix if necessary
4. [ ] Deploy rollback version if remote disable insufficient
5. [ ] Communicate with stakeholders

### 2. Partial Rollback

For less critical issues:

1. [ ] Disable specific problematic triggers
2. [ ] Increase cooldown periods
3. [ ] Reduce maximum prompts per user
4. [ ] Monitor impact of changes
5. [ ] Plan proper fix for next release
